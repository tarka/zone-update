A minimal Rust library providing CRUD-like operations on DNS records with various DNS providers.

## Overview

Zone Update is a lightweight library that provides a simple interface for
programmatically managing DNS zone records through provider APIs.
The library is both blocking and async, and supports multiple async runtimes
(see below).

### Supported DNS providers

Currently, Zone Update supports the following DNS providers:

* Cloudflare
* deSEC
* DigitalOcean
* Dnsimple
* DnsMadeEasy
* Gandi
* Porkbun

See the [DNS providers matrix](docs/PROVIDERS.md) for more details.

### Supported Runtimes

`zone-update` supports both blocking and async APIs. For async the library
attempts to be as provider-agnostic; it is known (tested) to work with the
following runtimes:

* [tokio](https://tokio.rs/)
* [smol](https://docs.rs/smol/)
* [compio](https://compio.rs/)

### Feature flags

Each DNS provider is gated behind their name, however all provider are enabled
by default. To limit the providers you can add `zone-update` to your
`Cargo.toml` in the following format:

```text
zone-update = { version = "*", default-features = false, features = ["digitalocean", "desec"] }
```

The other notable flag is `async`, which is not enabled by default.

## Usage

### Basic Example

```rust
use zone_update::{gandi, DnsProvider, errors::Result};
use std::net::Ipv4Addr;

fn update_gandi_record() -> Result<()> {
    let config = zone_update::Config {
        domain: "example.com".to_string(),
        dry_run: false,
    };
    
    let auth = gandi::Auth::ApiKey("your-api-key".to_string());
    let client = gandi::Gandi::new(config, auth);
    
    let host = "www";
    let new_ip = Ipv4Addr::new(192, 0, 2, 1);

    // Update the A record for www.example.com
    client.update_a_record(host, &new_ip)?;
    
    Ok(())
}
```

See the `examples` directory for other use-cases.

## Contributing

At this point the most useful contributions would be to add additional DNS
provider APIs. However other contributions are welcome.
